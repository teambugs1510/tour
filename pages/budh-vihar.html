				<p>The Buddha Vihar is located 6 kms from district headquarters on Sedam Road near Gulbarga University. Spread over 18 acres, it has a main building, a meditation centre at the cellar and a Lord Buddha chaitya (temple in Pali) on the ground floor. The dome of Buddavihar which is built on traditional Buddhist architecture is 70 ft in height and 59 ft in diameter. The main dome is tiled with marble for a grand look. The dome has an ornamental spire made of panchaloha with a kalasha on top of it also made of panchaloha. Buddha Vihara is surrounded by four 48ft tall Ashoka pillars in the four corners in honour of King Ashoka the Great.
