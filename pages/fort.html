				<p>HThe Gulbarga Fort is located in Gulbarga City in the Gulbarga district of North Karnataka. It was subsequently significantly enlarged in 1347 by Al-ud-din Hasan Bahmani of the Bahmani Dynasty after he cut off his ties with the Delhi Sultanate; Islamic monuments such as mosques, palaces, tombs, and other structures were also built later within the refurbished fort. The Jama Masjid built later, within the fort, in 1367, is a unique structure built in Persian architectural style, fully enclosed, with elegant domes and arched columns, which is unlike any other mosque in India. It was built to commemorate the establishment of the dynastic rule of the Bahmani kingdom at Gulbarga fort between 1327 and 1424. It remained the capital of the Bahmani Kingdom till 1424 where after the capital was shifted to Bidar Fort, as Bidar had better climatic conditions

<strong>History</strong>
<br>
The early history of the region dates back to the 6th century when the Rashtrakutas ruled over the external areas, except Gulbarga city. The Chalukyas won back their domain and ruled for over two hundred years. The Kalachuris of Kalyani succeeded them and ruled till the 12th century. At the end of the 12th century, it came under the reign of the Yadavas of Devagiri and the Hoysalas of Halebid. During this period, the Kakatiya dynasty, kings of Warangal were also powerful and took control of the present Gulbarga district and Raichur District.[4][5]

The Kakatiya power was subdued in 1321, and the northern Deccan, including the district of Gulbarga, passed under the control of the Muslim Sultanate of Delhi.[4][5]

In the early 14th century, the Deccan was occupied by Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate, which included Gulbarga. The revolt of the Muslim officers appointed from Delhi resulted in the founding of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347 by Alauddin Hassan, who chose Gulbarga (named as 'Ahsenabad' during this period) to be his capital. Gulbarga was the capital of the Bahmani kingdom (1347–1527) (with headquarters at the Gulbarga fort), a newly founded independent state, until 1424 when the capital was transferred to Bidar. It is said that with the establishment of the Bahmani Kingdom, the Muslim rule took firm roots in the Deccan. Ahmad Shah Wali Bahmani had inducted immigrants from Iraq, Iran and Central Asia, which changed the social, cultural and religious life in the Deccan but was well amalgamated with Hindu traditions.[1][4][5][6][7]

The Gulbarga fort was razed to the ground by the Vijayanagar Emperor but was subsequently rebuilt by Yusuf Adil Shah (1459–1511), who established the Adil Shah dynasty or Bijapur Sultanate, when he defeated the Vijayanagar emperor. The Vijayanagara Empire was plundered and with this rich booty, the Gulbarga fort was refurbished

<strong>World’s Longest Cannon at Bahmani Fort</strong>
<br>
The Bahmani Sultanate was a first independent Islamic state of the Deccan in South India and one of the great medieval Indian kingdoms. During the 191 years (1347-1538 A.D.) of Bahmani reign ruled with Gulbarga (Ahasnabad) and Bidar as their capital It was a great discovery for National award-winning artist and photographer Mohammed Ayazuddin Patel, Indo-Islamic Art of North Karnataka researcher Dr. Rehaman Patel and coin collector Mohammed Ismail that have found the World's longest canon in our own city.[citation needed]

It is exciting news for Gulbarga and Hyderabad Karnataka region people that the longest canon is located in Gulbarga fort installed during the reign of Bahmani Empire in the 14th century made by Turkish. It is made up of alloy (Panch dhatu).

It is the Bara Gazi toph (canon) which measures about 29 feet in length. The circumference is 7.6 feet, diameter 2 feet and thickness is 7 inch. The canon which claims to be the largest one in the world is just 23 feet long. This canon is located Koulas fort in Nizamabad district, Telangana.

The Asaf Jah-I (first Nizam) granted the Koulas fort to Rajput king Raja Kunwar Gopal Singh Gaur in 1724 AD for his bravery in the battle of Balapur and Shakkar Kheda.

The Archaeological Survey of India and State Archaeology should take immediate step to protect the Gulbarga fort canon and it should be included in the world record list. Fencing should be done around the canon for its safety. The canon is filled with mud and small stones which should be cleaned. Also, a signboard containing the details about the size of canon mentioning it as ‘the longest canon in the world is required.

The Bahmanis ruled over most of the Deccan until the late 15th and early 16th century, when the kingdom was divided into five independent states.[5][7][8][9]

The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (1658–1707) captured the fort in the 17th century (1687) and appointed Asaf Jah I ("Nizam-ul-Mulk") as the Governor of the Deccan. In the early part of the 18th century, when Mughal Empire was declining, the Nizam became independent in 1724, and formed the Hyderabad State, of which Gulbarga area was a part.[4][5][8]

The fort and the Gulbarga district were a part of Kingdom of Hyderabad under the Nizams rule. After India became independent in August 1947, Hyderabad state was annexed to the Indian union in 1948. In 1956, the Indian state of Hyderabad was partitioned among neighboring states along linguistic lines and renamed as Andhra Pradesh(now Telangana). Most of the Gulbarga district became part of the then Mysore state, later renamed Karnataka, excluding two taluks, which were given to Andhra Pradesh.[3]
